# Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer application built using Python and Tkinter. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

---

## Features

- **Work Timer**: Default work session of 25 minutes.
- **Short Break**: 5-minute break after each work session.
- **Long Break**: 20-minute break after 4 work sessions.
- **Visual Timer**: Displays remaining time in minutes and seconds.
- **Progress Tracking**: Adds checkmarks (`✔`) for each completed work session.
- **Custom UI**: A tomato-themed timer with a simple and intuitive interface.
- **Auto-Start**: Automatically transitions between work and break intervals.
